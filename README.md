DevSnicket Plug-in Discovery consists of a JavaScript repository object and a Babel plug-in that when used together can invert dependencies between modules and turn them into discovered plug-ins.

Currently CommonJS modules are only supported (e.g. not ECMAScript ones). There is partial support for modules in packages (see ["CommonJS Babel plug-in / package"](#commonjs-babel-plug-in--package) below).

## Create repository factory function / package

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@devsnicket/plugin-discovery-create-repository.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devsnicket/plugin-discovery-create-repository
)

Install using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devsnicket/plugin-discovery-create-repository):

```bash
npm install @devsnicket/plugin-discovery-create-repository
```
Or with [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/@devsnicket/plugin-discovery-create-repository):

```bash
yarn add @devsnicket/plugin-discovery-create-repository
```
The create repository package contains a factory function. When this function is called and the return repository object is exported a plug-in contract is defined (in this example "someSortOfPlugins").

```javascript
// someSortOfPlugins.js
module.exports =
	require("@devsnicket/plugin-discovery-create-repository")
	();
```

This can then be plugged into by objects/functions etc from other files.

```javascript
// plugin1.js
require("./someSortOfPlugins")
.plugin("plug-in number 1");
```

The plug-ins can then be iterated and used from other files.

```javascript
// consoleLogPlugins.js
for (const plugin require("./someSortOfPlugins"))
	console.log(plugin);
// output:
// plug-in number 1
```

The code above alone won't work as there isn't a module require call to import the 2nd plug-in file from the 3rd file that iterates the plug-ins. The purpose of the repository object is so plug-ins can be identified by the [@devsnicket/plugin-discovery-create-repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devsnicket/plugin-discovery-create-repository) package (see below) as it will automatically add the missing module require calls.

## CommonJS Babel plug-in / package

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@devsnicket/plugin-discovery-commonjs-babel-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devsnicket/plugin-discovery-commonjs-babel-plugin
)

Install using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devsnicket/plugin-discovery-commonjs-babel-plugin):

```bash
npm install --save-dev @devsnicket/plugin-discovery-commonjs-babel-plugin
```
Or with [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/@devsnicket/plugin-discovery-commonjs-babel-plugin):

```bash
yarn add --dev @devsnicket/plugin-discovery-commonjs-babel-plugin
```

The CommonJS Babel plug-in package discovers DevSnicket plug-in references and will automatically add module require calls where the package [@devsnicket/plugin-discovery-create-repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devsnicket/plugin-discovery-create-repository) has been used (see above).

The example above would be rewritten into:

```javascript
// someSortOfPlugins.js
module.exports =
	require("@devsnicket/plugin-discovery-create-repository")
	();
	
require("./plugin1.js")
```

The Babel plug-in will need to be specified in your [Babel configuration](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins#plugin-preset-paths), [WebPack Babel Loader configuration](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader#options) or equivalent. It has a single parameter named ignoreDirectoryNames. When not specified the parameter defaults to node_modules. Scanning of the node_modules directory for plug-ins would be inefficient and likely to take a long time.

When using WebPack it will run Babel for the plug-in repository even if its in a node_modules directory. This means plug-ins will be discovered and rewritten into the output plug-in repository file so long as they aren't also in the node_modules directory (see above).

## Example

An example of Plug-in Discovery in use can be found in [Eunice](https://github.com/DevSnicket/Eunice). A plug-in repository is defined for its test harnesses ([Harnesses/processorPlugins.js](https://github.com/DevSnicket/Eunice/blob/master/Harnesses/processorPlugins.js)) so [processors](https://github.com/DevSnicket/Eunice/tree/master/Processors) can be discovered and included automatically.
